# Raiden EthCC Demo

This is a small application to demonstrate the simple usage of the [Raiden Light
Client](https://github.com/raiden-network/light-client), using its TypeScript
library in a little _React_ application.

## Getting Started

After cloning this repository (`git clone
https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-ethcc-2021.git`), run `yarn install` to
setup the project and install all of its dependencies.

To run the application, just execute `yarn start` in the root directory of the
repository. It will start an automatically updating development server and opens
it in the web-browser.

The main implementation of the application takes places in the `./src/App.js`
file. Its the only file that need to be touched for this demonstration.
